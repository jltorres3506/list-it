# Description
A web app that allows you to make many lists as you like, so you can keep track of things that need to be done, or just things that you want to remember or maybe just ideas for later

# Reason for app
I use to keep track of things such as todo lists and ideas and other such things on sticky notes and pieces of paper, 
but at times that was very hard to keep track of, so i came up with this app to do just that.
